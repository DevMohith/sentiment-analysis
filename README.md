## 📘 Sentiment Analyzer with React, Flask & Vertex AI

### 🎯 Project Description
A production-ready fullstack AI-powered sentiment analyzer app that integrates Google Cloud's **Vertex AI** (Text-Bison PaLM 2 model) with a **React frontend** and **Flask backend**. Users can input a sentence and receive real-time sentiment classification (positive, negative, or neutral). Deployed using **Cloud Run** (backend) and **Firebase Hosting** (frontend)

### 🚀 Production URLs
- 🔗 **Live Frontend App**: [https://sentiment-analyzer-45592-f07a0.web.app](https://sentiment-analyzer-45592-f07a0.web.app)
- 🔧 **Backend API**: [https://sentiment-analyzer-backend-283131268302.us-central1.run.app](https://sentiment-analyzer-backend-283131268302.us-central1.run.app)

## 🔍 What I Wanted to Achieve
I wanted to challenge myself by:
- Using pretrained LLMs available in the market
- Integrating them into a real-world fullstack application
- Gaining hands-on experience with GenAI APIs, cloud authentication, and building an AI workflow

---

## 🛠️ What I Used
- **Frontend:** React.js (for user interaction)
- **Backend:** Python Flask (to process requests and connect to the model)
- **AI Model:** Text-Bison (`text-bison@001`) via Vertex AI
- **Cloud Auth:** GCP service account (for secure access)

---

## 🌟 Highlights
- Built my own `/analyze` API Endpoint to act as a bridge between the frontend and Google's AI model.
- Carefully structured prompts to extract accurate sentiment output from the model.
- Handled real-time responses from a powerful LLM and returned clean output to the user.
- Dealt with cloud permissions, CORS issues, SDK limitations — and learned how to debug them.
- I didn’t train a model — I focused on using a production-ready one efficiently.

---

## 💡 Why This Project Matters to Me
This project helped me:
- Explore how developers can leverage existing AI tools without building from scratch
- Understand the bridge between traditional development and cloud-based AI services
- Learn how to think in terms of workflows, not just code
- Push myself into the real world of integrating AI with software products

---

## ✅ Result
After several experiments, refactors, and debugging sessions:
- Successfully built a working app
- The model responds to live user input
- I fully understood what it takes to integrate AI into a real system

---

## 💬 Personal Note
Today I’m really proud.
This project wasn’t just about making something work — it was about learning how to think like a developer who works with AI, and I feel one step closer to that.

---

## 🔭 Next Goals
- Add multiple models and compare results
- Move to serverless deployment (e.g., Cloud Run ✅)
- Explore fine-tuning and training in Vertex AI
- Make it portfolio-ready for recruiters and real users
