#  Sentiment Analyzer with React, Flask & Vertex AI

A fullstack AI-powered sentiment analyzer that uses **Google Cloud's Vertex AI** to classify user input as positive, negative, or neutral — built using **React**, **Flask**, and **Text-Bison (PaLM 2)** model.

---

## What I Wanted to Achieve

I wanted to challenge myself by:
- Using **pretrained LLMs available in the market**
- Integrating them into a **real-world fullstack application**
- Gaining hands-on experience with **GenAI APIs**, cloud authentication, and building an AI workflow

---

## What I Used

- **Frontend:** React.js (for user interaction)
- **Backend:** Python Flask (to process requests and connect to the model)
- **AI Model:** Text-Bison (`text-bison@001`) via Vertex AI
- **Cloud Auth:** GCP service account (for secure access)

---

## Highlights

- Built my own `/analyze` API to act as a bridge between the frontend and Google's AI model.
- Carefully structured prompts to extract accurate sentiment output from the model.
- Handled real-time responses from a powerful LLM and returned clean output to the user.
- Dealt with cloud permissions, CORS issues, SDK limitations — and learned how to debug them.
- I didn’t train a model — I focused on **using a production-ready one efficiently.**

## Why This Project Matters to Me

This project helped me:
- Explore how developers can leverage existing AI tools without building from scratch
- Understand the bridge between **traditional development** and **cloud-based AI services**
- Learn how to think in **terms of workflows**, not just code
- Push myself into the **real world of integrating AI with software products**

---

## Result

After several experiments, refactors, and debugging sessions:
-  Successfully built a working app
-  The model responds to live user input
-  I fully understood what it takes to integrate AI into a real system

---

##  Personal Note

Today I’m really proud.  
This project wasn’t just about making something work — it was about **learning how to think like a developer who works with AI**, and I feel one step closer to that.

---

## Next Goals

- Add multiple models and compare results
- Move to serverless deployment (e.g., Cloud Run)
- Explore fine-tuning and training in Vertex AI
- Make it portfolio-ready for recruiters and real users
